## Table of Contents

### Plans

* [`bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs`](#bolt_doc_exampleamixed_docs): A concise, single-line `@summary`, suitable for a list or hyperlink
* [`bolt_doc_example::b::multiline_summary`](#bolt_doc_examplebmultiline_summary): A multiple-line `@summary`,  without an untagged block

A multi-line `@summary` block works okay with `bolt plan show`, but
dramatically breaks the formatting of Puppet Strings' `REFERENCE.md` by
rendering the entire block inside the TOC link's description (complete with
line breaks).

1. `REFERENCE.md` includes the **entire `@summary` block** in the Plan's TOC
  - This breaks the formatting of the TOC rather badly
2. `bolt plan show` displays most of the first line, except the final word
   * It replaces the last word ("block") with "...", even though it display
     the (much longer) single-line `@summary` from
     **`bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs`** without any truncation
* [`bolt_doc_example::c::untagged_only`](#bolt_doc_examplecuntagged_only): Untagged description block  This sentence is on a new line, demonstrating that a lone untagged block of text is not a great choice for either

## Plans

### <a name="bolt_doc_exampleamixed_docs"></a>`bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs`

This is a longer, untagged block to describe the plan in more detail,
including any important behaviors, pre-requisites, quirks, or other
non-obvious considerations that a user should be aware of.

When `puppet strings` generates a `REFERENCE.md` from this plan, it uses the
`@summary` text in the TOC and this untagged block of text in the Plan's
details.

Ideally, `bolt plan show` would treat the plan's docs the same way:

  1. `bolt plan show` would display the short `@summary`
  2. `bolt plan show bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs` would include the
      content of this untagged block

However, what actually happens is that `bolt plan show
bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs` only shows the short `@summary` text, and
**all the content in this untagged block is completely lost!** :bomb:

* **Note** As an alternative, I considered using multiple `@note` tags (instead of this
untagged text block) to document details that don't belong in a `@summary`.
That did't work, either:

  * `puppet strings` only renders a plan's first  `@note` tag
  * `bolt plan show <specific::plan>` ignores `@note` completely

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs` plan:

* [`targets`](#targets)

##### <a name="targets"></a>`targets`

Data type: `TargetSpec`

The targets to run on.

Default value: `"localhost"`

### <a name="bolt_doc_examplebmultiline_summary"></a>`bolt_doc_example::b::multiline_summary`

A multiple-line `@summary`,  without an untagged block

A multi-line `@summary` block works okay with `bolt plan show`, but
dramatically breaks the formatting of Puppet Strings' `REFERENCE.md` by
rendering the entire block inside the TOC link's description (complete with
line breaks).

1. `REFERENCE.md` includes the **entire `@summary` block** in the Plan's TOC
  - This breaks the formatting of the TOC rather badly
2. `bolt plan show` displays most of the first line, except the final word
   * It replaces the last word ("block") with "...", even though it display
     the (much longer) single-line `@summary` from
     **`bolt_doc_example::a::mixed_docs`** without any truncation

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `bolt_doc_example::b::multiline_summary` plan:

* [`targets`](#targets)

##### <a name="targets"></a>`targets`

Data type: `TargetSpec`

The targets to run on.

Default value: `"localhost"`

### <a name="bolt_doc_examplecuntagged_only"></a>`bolt_doc_example::c::untagged_only`

Untagged description block

This sentence is on a new line, demonstrating that a lone untagged block of
text is not a great choice for either Puppet Strings or `bolt plan show`.

1. `bolt plan show` weirdly chops off the description's third word ("block"),
   resulting in `Untagged description...`

2. The `REFERENCE.md` includes most of the first few lines, rendered as if
   they had no line breaks.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `bolt_doc_example::c::untagged_only` plan:

* [`targets`](#targets)

##### <a name="targets"></a>`targets`

Data type: `TargetSpec`

The targets to run on.

Default value: `"localhost"`
